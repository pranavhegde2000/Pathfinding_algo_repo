# Pathfinding_algo_repo
I am gonna be using the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and visualize path finding using React, might add up few more components like make a snake game AI that where the snake uses the shortest path to devour the little ball thing
Also this is the first time I am doing sonething on Github that might have some significance....
I will be adding in more algorithms that can be used for pathfinding in time, but for now its good old Dijkstra's algorithm
